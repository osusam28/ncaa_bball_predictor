## 🔑 Key Factors

### 1. The Best Offense vs One of the Best Defenses
Illinois has the **#1 offense in the nation** (130.9 AdjOE) – a massive weapon led by Big Ten POY candidate **Keaton Wagler** and Serbian PG **Mihailo Petrovic** (14.2 ppg, 7.3 apg). But Nebraska counters with the **#7 defense** (93.1 AdjDE) – a gritty, well-coached unit. This is the ultimate strength-on-strength matchup.

### 2. Fortress Pinnacle Bank
Nebraska is **dominant at home**, especially against Big Ten opponents (averaging +19.3 point margin). They've only lost once all season. Illinois is walking into one of the toughest environments in the conference.

### 3. Key Players
*   **Illinois**: Wagler, Petrovic, and the Ivisic brothers (7-footers) give the Illini offensive versatility.
*   **Nebraska**: Brice Williams (20.4 ppg) leads the attack. Rienk Mast's return from injury is crucial for their interior balance. If Mast or Frager are out, Illinois gains a significant advantage.

### 4. Resume Comparison
Nebraska's 20-1 record and +7.07 WAB is quietly one of the best in the country. Illinois is excellent (18-3), but Nebraska has simply won more and against a comparable schedule.

## 📰 What The Web Says
*   Computer models give Nebraska 54-67% win probability.
*   ESPN sees it as nearly a toss-up (54% Nebraska).
*   Physical, grinding Big Ten battle expected.

## 📝 Conclusion
This is a near coin-flip game between two elite teams. However, Nebraska's **elite home court**, **dominant defense (#7)**, and **near-perfect record (20-1)** give them the edge. Illinois' offense is unstoppable on paper, but Nebraska's defensive identity and crowd will slow them down just enough. Expect a low-scoring, grind-it-out affair.

**The Pick**: Nebraska 72 - Illinois 68.
