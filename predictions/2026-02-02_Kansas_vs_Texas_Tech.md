# Prediction: #13 Texas Tech vs #11 Kansas
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Venue:** United Supermarkets Arena, Lubbock, TX

## Prediction Summary
**Winner:** Texas Tech
**Projected Score:** Texas Tech 78, Kansas 74
**Confidence:** Medium

Texas Tech (-4.5) enters this home matchup with a schematic advantage on the perimeter. While Kansas boasts a top-15 defense overall, their specific weakness defending the three-point line (10th in Big 12, 35.8% allowed) aligns poorly with Texas Tech's conference-leading 3-point offense (41.9%). Combine this with the Red Raiders' strong home court advantage in Lubbock and uncertainty surrounding Kansas freshman star Darryn Peterson's health (cramps), and the edge goes to the home team.

## Key Matchup Insights

### 1. Perimeter Mismatch (Critical Factor)
- **Texas Tech Offense**: Elite shooting (AdjOE #8). They lead the Big 12 in 3PT%, hitting nearly 42% from deep.
- **Kansas Defense**: While stout inside (AdjDE #13), the Jayhawks have struggled to chase shooters off the line. If Tech gets hot early, Kansas may struggle to trade baskets.

### 2. The "Lubbock" Factor
- Texas Tech has won the last two meetings against Kansas, including a blowout in their last Lubbock encounter.
- Home court in the Big 12 is worth ~3-4 points, which is significant in a game between statistically similar teams (WAB: KU 4.1 vs TTU 3.9).
- **Lesson Applied**: *Conference Parity* - Reduced the predicted margin to account for Big 12 competitiveness (Line is 4.5, predicted 4).

### 3. Injury Watch: Darryn Peterson
- Kansas key freshman Darryn Peterson is dealing with cramping issues that limited him against BYU.
- **Lesson Applied**: *Injury Verification* - His potentially limited mobility or minutes significantly lowers Kansas's offensive ceiling in a road environment.

**Predicted Margin:** Texas Tech +4
