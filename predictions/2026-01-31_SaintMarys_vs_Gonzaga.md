## 🔑 Key Factors

### 1. Tempo Battle Is Everything
This matchup always comes down to tempo. Saint Mary's plays the slowest style in the WCC (65.3), grinding games into half-court battles. Gonzaga wants to push pace (70.0). **If St. Mary's can control tempo, they can keep this close**. History shows they've done it before – winning 6 of the last 8 meetings with the Zags.

### 2. Gonzaga's Elite Defense
Gonzaga's #11 defense (94.1 AdjDE) is their X-factor. They limit opponents to just 26.8% from three. St. Mary's relies on efficient shooting (39.7% from 3), so this will be a key battleground.

### 3. Historical Rivalry
Saint Mary's has **won 3 of the last 4** against Gonzaga. Only 3 of the last 11 matchups have been double-digit Gonzaga victories. This is not a typical "Zags blowout" game.

### 4. Key Players
*   **Gonzaga**: **Graham Ike** (18.8 ppg, 8.1 rpg) returns from injury. Dominant interior presence.
*   **Saint Mary's**: **Paulius Murauskas** (19.3 ppg) and 7-foot-3 **Andrew McKeever** (near double-double) anchor the Gaels.

## 📰 What The Web Says
*   Gonzaga is an 8.5-9.5 point favorite. The Over/Under is ~145 points (low total reflects tempo).
*   One model predicts a Saint Mary's upset, 87-82.
*   Most analysts expect Saint Mary's to cover the spread.

## 📝 Qualitative Notes (From System)
*   *"The Zags looked fast today."* – This suggests Gonzaga's tempo advantage may be peaking.

## 📝 Conclusion
Gonzaga is the superior team by every advanced metric, but **Saint Mary's is built to play spoiler** in this specific matchup. Their slow tempo, physical defense, and recent success against the Zags make them dangerous. Gonzaga's elite defense should ultimately prevail, but expect a grind-it-out game with a single-digit margin.

**The Pick**: Gonzaga wins, but Saint Mary's covers (+8.5). Final: **Gonzaga 74 - Saint Mary's 68**.
