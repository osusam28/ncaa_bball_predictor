## Key Matchup: Shooting Efficiency

*   **John Mobley Jr. (OSU)**: 15.8 PPG. Secondary scoring threat.
*   **Devin Royal (OSU)**: 14.1 PPG. Third option provides depth.
*   **David Coit (UMD)**: 14.8 PPG on 41.9% shooting. Must be efficient for any upset chance.

## Confidence: **High**

The efficiency gap (+15) and shooting mismatch (+9 eFG edge) are overwhelming. Maryland's defensive struggles (55.3% eFG allowed) will be exploited by OSU's three-headed attack (Thornton/Mobley/Royal). While OSU's road woes are noted, Maryland's severe limitations make this a confident pick.

> [!WARNING]
> **Historical caution**: OSU is 1-7 at Maryland all-time. However, this Maryland team is their worst in years (1-9 conference). Trust the efficiency gap.
