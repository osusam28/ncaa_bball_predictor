## Key Matchup: Shooting vs Turnovers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Iowa's **58.5% eFG** (13th nationally) is elite, but they also **force 22.1% turnovers** while committing 16.1%. If Washington can protect the ball and hit the boards (35.3% ORB), they can keep this close.

## Confidence: **Medium**

This is a close game. Iowa's efficiency edge (+9) is reduced by Washington's home court (9-3) and rebounding advantage (35.3% ORB). Expect a competitive second half. Iowa's shooting efficiency should ultimately prevail, but it won't be a blowout.
