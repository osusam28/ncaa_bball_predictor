## 🔑 Key Factors

### 1. Irresistible Force vs Immovable Object
This is a textbook clash of styles. Alabama has the **#2 offense in the nation** (129.4 AdjOE) – an explosive, fast-paced attack under Nate Oats. But Florida counters with the **#8 defense** (93.4 AdjDE) – the unit that anchored their national championship run last year. Historically, elite defense travels better than elite offense.

### 2. Tempo Control
Alabama wants to score in transition (73.1 tempo). Florida prefers a more controlled pace (69.6). **If Florida can slow the game down and force half-court possessions, their defensive superiority takes over.** Florida's physicality will be key.

### 3. Florida's Championship Experience
The Gators are the **reigning national champions** with key players returning (Alex Condon, Rueben Chinyelu). They also added elite transfers (Boogie Fland, Xaivian Lee). This experience and depth matters in close games.

### 4. Recent Head-to-Head
Florida has won the **last 4 meetings** against Alabama, averaging 102.5 ppg in those games. Alabama's Charles Bediako historically played well vs Florida, but the Gators' new roster is built differently.

## 📰 What The Web Says
*   Florida is widely projected as a top SEC and national title contender.
*   Alabama's offense is explosive but their defense (#59) is a liability.
*   Florida's coach Todd Golden quoted: "We're gonna beat 'em anyways."

## 📝 Conclusion
Alabama's offense is terrifying, but their defensive vulnerability (#59 vs Florida's #8) is the deciding factor. Florida's disciplined, championship-caliber defense should contain Alabama's pace-and-space attack just enough to win a high-scoring game. Expect a shootout, but the Gators' ability to get stops in crunch time gives them the edge.

**The Pick**: Florida 78 - Alabama 74.
