## Situational Factors

### Bounce-Back Games

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Elite players in "must-prove" situations after blowout losses are dangerous. Weight bounce-back factor higher.

- **Source**: Kentucky 85-77 win at Arkansas after 25-pt loss to Vanderbilt (2026-01-31)
- **Application**: Check if team is coming off a 15+ point loss in last 2 games. If so, consider upgrading their projected performance.

### Home Court Streaks

> [!WARNING]  
> Don't over-rely on home winning streaks. Streaks break against elite opponents.

- **Source**: Arkansas's 17-game home streak broken by Kentucky (2026-01-31)
- **Application**: When opponent is Top 25, weight opponent quality over home record.

### "Nothing to Lose" Underdogs

> [!TIP]
> Heavy underdogs in conference play often create trap games. Apply caution to blowout predictions.

- **Source**: Ole Miss closed to within 2 pts vs Vanderbilt as heavy underdog (2026-01-31)
- **Application**: Cap predicted margin at 12 for conference underdogs with nothing to lose.

## Pre-Game Checks

### Injury Verification

> [!CAUTION]
> Always verify active roster before finalizing prediction. Missing secondary scorers impacts margins significantly.

- **Source**: Duke Miles absence reduced Vanderbilt margin from 15 to 3 (2026-01-31)
- **Application**: Web search for "{Team} injury report" before predictions. Adjust margin if key players are out.

## Margin Calibration

### Conference Parity

> [!NOTE]
> SEC/Big 12 conference games are rarely as lopsided as efficiency metrics suggest.

- **Source**: Multiple conference game margins were 10+ points off predictions
- **Application**: Reduce predicted margin by ~20% for SEC/Big 12 matchups.

---

### Historic Offense Adjustment

> [!NOTE]
> When facing a historically elite offense (#1-5 KenPom), defensive edge should be discounted unless defense is also elite.

- **Source**: Illinois's #1 historic offense beat Nebraska's #7 defense (2026-02-01)
- **Application**: If opponent has top-5 offense, do not favor defense unless it's also top-5.
