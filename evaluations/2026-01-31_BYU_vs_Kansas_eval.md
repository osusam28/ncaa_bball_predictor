## 🔍 Analysis

### Execution of Game Plan
The prediction correctly identified Kansas as the winner and accurately projected a close, competitive game. The margin error of just 4 points is within the "accurate" threshold.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Higher Scoring Than Expected**: Both teams exceeded their projected scores (Kansas +12, BYU +8). The predicted total was 152; actual total was 172. The "shootout early" thesis held but Kansas didn't "clamp down" on defense as predicted.

2. **Richie Saunders' Explosion**: BYU's Richie Saunders scored 33 points (24 in the second half) with a double-double. This individual performance wasn't predicted, but ultimately didn't change the outcome.

3. **Kansas Stars Delivered**: Bryson Tiller (21 pts) and Darryn Peterson (18 pts) performed as expected, maintaining Kansas's offensive edge in a high-scoring affair.

4. **Allen Fieldhouse Factor**: Playing at home, Kansas overcame a BYU second-half surge to secure the win—consistent with the "battle-tested" thesis.

## 💡 Improvement Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> ### Good Prediction Logic
> The model correctly weighted Kansas's elite defense and tougher schedule. The "close game" thesis was validated.

1. **Refine Over/Under Predictions**: The game went way over the predicted 152-point total. Consider tracking tempo trends in recent games to anticipate high-scoring matchups.

2. **Track "Hot Shooter" Potential**: Richie Saunders' 33-point outburst shows how individual performances can swing margins. Consider adding "ceiling game" projections for secondary stars.
