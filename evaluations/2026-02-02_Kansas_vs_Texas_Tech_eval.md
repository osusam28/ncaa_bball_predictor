## Evaluation
**Rating:** Significantly Off (Wrong Winner)

### What Went Wrong?
1.  **Defensive Grind vs Offensive Optimism**: The prediction forecasted a high-scoring affair (Over 154) driven by Texas Tech's #8 offense and Kansas's transition play. Instead, the game was a defensive struggle (Total 125). Texas Tech shot just 34.9% from 3 on massive volume (43 attempts), while Kansas struggled to 22% from deep. The "Perimeter Mismatch" theory held partially true (Tech made 11 more 3s), but it wasn't enough to overcome Kansas's interior and defensive pressure.
2.  **The "Peterson" Factor**: The analysis flagged Darryn Peterson's cramps as a major risk ("potentially limited mobility"). Instead, Peterson was the game's MVP, scoring 19 points and hitting two clutch 3-pointers in the final 80 seconds to erase a deficit. His health was a non-factor in the clutch.
3.  **Resilience**: Kansas overcame a late 9-point deficit, showing "Championship DNA" that quantitative metrics often miss.

### Lessons for Future
-   **"Probable" Means "Go"**: If a star is active, assume 100% capacity in crunch time unless structurally injured (e.g., knee/ankle vs cramps).
-   **Big 12 Unders**: Be skeptical of "Over" predictions in conference matchups between Top 25 teams. The intensity often forces lower efficiency.
-   **Margin Error Context**: A 7-point margin error is statistically "Accurate" (<10), but picking the loser in a one-possession game is a qualitative miss.
