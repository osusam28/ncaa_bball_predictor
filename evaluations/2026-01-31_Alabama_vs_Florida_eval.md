## 🔍 Analysis: What We Missed

The prediction correctly identified Florida as the winner but **severely underestimated their margin of victory**. Here's what happened:

### 1. 🏀 Frontcourt Dominance Was Historic
Florida outscored Alabama **72-26 in the paint**. The prediction acknowledged Florida's defensive strength but didn't anticipate the complete interior annihilation:
- **Alex Condon**: 25 points
- **Thomas Haugh**: 22 points  
- **Rueben Chinyelu**: 14 points, 17 rebounds (double-double)
- The trio combined for **61 points, 29 rebounds, 5 blocks**

### 2. 🔒 Defensive Lockdown Beyond Expectations
- Alabama averages **92 ppg** but was held to **77 points**
- **Labaron Philon** (averaging 22 ppg) was held to just **14 points** by Boogie Fland
- Florida's #8 defense didn't just contain Alabama's #2 offense—it **dominated** it

### 3. 🏡 Home Court Amplified Everything
The prediction noted the stylistic matchup but underweighted the atmosphere at the O'Connell Center:
- Florida went on a **13-2 run** late in the first half
- The student section was reportedly hostile (taunting Charles Bediako)
- Home-court energy accelerated Florida's defensive intensity

### 4. 📊 Boogie Fland's Two-Way Performance
Fland's **8 steals** (career-high, matching program record) plus **8 assists** and **15 points** was a game-changing variable we didn't model. His perimeter defense disrupted Alabama's rhythm entirely.

| **Frontcourt Size Mismatch** | Compare interior player heights/weights when teams meet | Medium |
| **Recent Scoring Highs** | Track if teams are on hot streaks in specific areas (paint, 3PT) | Low |

## ✅ What We Got Right

- ✅ Correctly picked **Florida to win**
- ✅ Identified the **defense vs offense clash** as key

## 📝 Final Notes

This was a correct pick but the margin error was significant. The model correctly read Florida as the superior team but underestimated *how much* Florida's frontcourt and perimeter defense would dominate. **Interior scoring differential** (72-26 in the paint) should be a key variable to track going forward.

**Series Note**: Florida has now won **5 consecutive games** against Alabama.
