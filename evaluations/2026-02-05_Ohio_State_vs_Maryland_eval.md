## Verdict: ⚠️ SIGNIFICANTLY OFF (Margin)

---

## Analysis: What Was Missed

### 1. **Turnover Exploitation (Key Factor)**
Ohio State dominated points off turnovers: **24-8**. They had a **13-0 advantage** in the first half alone.
- Our prediction noted OSU's +3 edge in turnover rate, but this translates to massive point differential when Maryland commits errors under pressure.
- **Lesson**: When a team has poor ball security (Maryland 18% TOV rate), AND opponent forces turnovers aggressively (OSU 15.8% defensive TOV rate), the margin can snowball.

### 2. **Christoph Tilly Emergence**
Our player watch focused on Thornton/Mobley Jr./Royal, but **Christoph Tilly led the team with 19 points** (7-10 shooting, 11 in the first half).
- This fourth scoring option wasn't tracked.
- **Lesson**: Consider adding "depth scoring" notes for teams with multiple double-digit scorers.

### 3. **OSU's Bounce-Back Intensity**
We gave +1 point for bounce-back, but OSU's response to the Wisconsin loss was more emphatic than predicted. They shot 57.1% overall.
- **Lesson**: After road losses, teams returning to easier opponents may overcompensate. Consider +2-3 for bounce-back vs struggling teams.

### 4. **Maryland's Complete Collapse**
Maryland's defensive struggles (55.3% eFG allowed) combined with their turnover issues created a compounding effect.
- They scored only 5 points in the final 4 minutes of the first half.
- **Lesson**: When a team has BOTH poor defense AND poor ball security, expect margins to exceed efficiency-based predictions.

## Improvement Suggestions

> [!TIP]
> **Consider adding to `prediction_lessons.md`:**
> - "Turnover Compound Effect": When underdog has high TOV rate AND opponent forces turnovers, increase predicted margin by 3-5 points.
> - "Bounce-Back vs Struggling Teams": When favorite is bouncing back against a bottom-tier conference team, upgrade bounce-back adjustment from +1 to +3.

> [!NOTE]
> **Consider adding to team docs:**
> - Track "Depth Scoring" — number of players averaging 10+ PPG. OSU has 4+ (Thornton, Mobley Jr., Royal, Tilly).

## What Worked
- ✅ Correctly predicted winner with High Confidence
- ✅ Identified shooting mismatch as key factor (OSU shot 57.1%)
- ✅ Noted Maryland's defensive struggles (55.3% eFG allowed)
- ✅ Flagged OSU's historical road struggles at Maryland (correctly dismissed given UMD's quality)

---

## Final Notes
The winner was correct and the direction was right. The margin error stems from underweighting turnover-based scoring and Maryland's complete inability to compete at any level. This was a "worse than expected" performance by Maryland rather than an "unexpected" OSU surge.
