## 🔍 Analysis

### Execution of Game Plan
The prediction was exceptionally close to the final outcome. The core thesis—that Saint Mary's would control tempo and keep the game within a single-digit margin despite Gonzaga's superior efficiency—held true.

**Key Highlights:**
1. **Tempo Control**: Saint Mary's successfully bogged down the game (Halftime: 38-34), keeping it well below Gonzaga's usual high-scoring pace.
2. **Graham Ike Factor**: The prediction correctly identified Graham Ike as a dominant interior presence. He finished with **30 points**, proving to be the difference-maker in the second half.
3. **The Spread**: Predicted Saint Mary's would cover a +8.5 spread. They lost by 8, covering by a narrow 0.5-point margin.

### Minor Discrepancies
* **Saint Mary's Scoring**: Predicted 68 points, they scored 65. The defensive battle was slightly more intense than projected.
* **Gonzaga Scoring**: Predicted 74 points, they scored 73. Nearly perfect.

## 💡 Improvement Suggestions

> [!NOTE]
> ### Good Prediction Logic
> The model's decision to favor the "grind-it-out" narrative over a Gonzaga blowout was correct. This suggests that **Historical Rivalry** and **Tempo Mismatch** metrics are working well.

1. **Continue Weighting Matchup History**: The recent success of Saint Mary's against Gonzaga was a valid predictor of a close game, even if the "Power Rankings" suggested a wider gap.
2. **Refine Star Player Ceiling**: Graham Ike's 30-point explosion was at the high end of expectations. Adding "Ceiling/Floor" projections for key players in the team docs could help refine score predictions further.
