## 🔍 What Happened?

### The Upset
Kentucky pulled off a road upset at Bud Walton Arena, defeating #15 Arkansas 85-77. This snapped Arkansas's **17-game home winning streak**.

### Key Factors Missed

1. **Otega Oweh's Dominant Performance**
   - Scored **24 points** with 8 rebounds and 3 assists
   - Scored 10 points in the final 10 minutes to seal the victory
   - The prediction acknowledged Oweh as a factor but underestimated his ability to single-handedly flip the game

2. **Kentucky's Shooting Explosion**
   - Shot **53.6% from the field** and **46% from three**
   - Significantly outperformed their season averages
   - Road shooting performance was unpredictable based on prior games

3. **Rebounding Dominance**
   - Kentucky outrebounded Arkansas **35-26**
   - This neutralized Arkansas's tempo advantage and created second-chance opportunities

4. **Supporting Cast Stepped Up**
   - Collin Chandler: 13 points
   - Malachi Moreno: 11 points, 7 rebounds
   - Denzel Aberdeen: 10 points
   - Four double-digit scorers gave Kentucky depth

5. **Arkansas Technical Foul Issues**
   - Three technical fouls in the second half disrupted Arkansas's rhythm
   - Gave Kentucky free points and momentum at critical moments

## 💡 Improvement Suggestions

> [!TIP]
> ### For Future Predictions

1. **Weight Star Player "Bounce-Back" Potential**
   - Kentucky was coming off a 25-point loss to Vanderbilt
   - Elite players like Oweh often respond with big performances after bad games
   - Consider adding a "bounce-back factor" for teams/players coming off blowout losses

2. **Don't Over-Weight Home Records**
   - Arkansas's 13-0 (later 17-0) home record was heavily weighted
   - Streaks break; elite opponents can overcome home court
   - Consider opponent quality in road games more heavily

3. **Add Rebounding Differential to Key Factors**
   - Kentucky's +9 rebounding margin was decisive
   - Add rebounding differential as a tracked metric in team docs

4. **Track Team Three-Point Shooting Variance**
   - Kentucky's 46% 3PT shooting was well above average
   - Track 3PT ceiling games to understand upset potential

5. **Monitor Momentum After Bad Losses**
   - Teams with pride often "reset" after embarrassing losses
   - Factor in recency of blowout losses as a potential motivator

## 📝 Conclusion

This was a significant miss. The model correctly identified Oweh as a key factor but underestimated his ability to dominate in a hostile environment. The prediction over-relied on Arkansas's home record and didn't account for Kentucky's potential for a bounce-back performance after their Vanderbilt loss. The rebounding battle and Kentucky's hot shooting were the nail in the coffin.

**Lesson**: Elite players in "must-prove" situations after bad losses are dangerous. Weight this factor higher.
