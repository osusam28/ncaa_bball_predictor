## Verdict: ✅ ACCURATE PREDICTION

The prediction correctly identified Tennessee as the winner. The margin error of only **4 points** is well within the acceptable threshold (<10).

### What Worked Well
1. **Efficiency Gap Analysis**: The +17 adjusted efficiency advantage correctly signaled Tennessee's dominance.
2. **Rebounding Mismatch**: Tennessee's elite 45% ORB% was correctly identified as the "game-breaker." This translated to second-chance points.
3. **Momentum/Home Court**: The adjustments for Knoxville's home advantage (+2) and Ole Miss's losing streak (+1) were directionally accurate.
4. **Player Performance**: Ja'Kobi Gillespie scored 20 points (predicted 18-22). Nate Ament unexpectedly exploded for 28 points.

### Minor Notes
- **Actual margin (18) exceeded predicted margin (14)** — Tennessee's second-half shooting surge (led by Ament's 26 second-half points) added extra cushion.
- AJ Storr and Patton Pinkins each scored 15 for Ole Miss, showing some fight but not enough to overcome Tennessee's dominance.
