## 🔍 What Happened?

### The Close Call
Vanderbilt edged out Ole Miss 71-68 in a game that was much closer than the predicted 15-point "comfortable" victory. While the winner was correct, the degree of dominance was significantly overestimated.

### Key Factors Missed

1. **Injury to Duke Miles**
   - Vanderbilt played without **Duke Miles**, their second-leading scorer.
   - The prediction did not account for this absence, which significantly impacted Vanderbilt's offensive efficiency and depth.

2. **Ole Miss Second-Half Resilience**
   - Ole Miss outscored Vanderbilt **45-40 in the second half**.
   - The prediction characterized Ole Miss as "struggling" and likely to fold, but they showed significant grit, closing the gap to 2 points in the final seconds.

3. **AJ Storr and Malik Dia Performance**
   - Both players scored **16 points** and were inches away from tying the game with last-second three-point attempts.
   - Their ability to compete with Vanderbilt's elite defense was underestimated.

4. **Tyler Tanner Carrying the Load**
   - With Miles out, Tanner scored **24 points** (above his 17.5 average).
   - While he stepped up, the lack of secondary scoring options made the game a grind.

5. **Free Throw Battle**
   - Vanderbilt's AK Okereke was the "separator," going 11-of-13 from the line.
   - Without this free-throw dominance, Vanderbilt might have lost.

## 💡 Improvement Suggestions

> [!TIP]
> ### For Future Predictions

1. **Check for Late-Breaking Injuries**
   - The absence of Duke Miles was a major factor. 
   - Suggestion: Implement a more robust "Pre-Game Injury Check" step in the `/predict` workflow or integrate a real-time injury tracker.

2. **Be Cautious of "Blowout" Predictions in Conference Play**
   - SEC matchups (especially mid-season) are rarely as lopsided as efficiency metrics suggest.
   - Suggestion: Apply a "Conference Parity" modifier that reduces predicted margins for conference rivalries.

3. **Value "Nothing to Lose" Motivation**
   - Ole Miss lost their home court due to weather and was playing as a heavy underdog. This often creates a "trap game" environment for the favorite.

4. **Track Secondary Scoring Depth**
   - When a top scorer is out, the drop-off in efficiency is often non-linear.
   - Suggestion: Analyze "Bench Efficiency" or "Scoring Concentration" to see how teams handle missing stars.

## 📝 Conclusion

The model correctly identified the better team but failed to account for a critical injury and underestimated the resilience of an SEC underdog. The 12-point margin error highlights a need for better injury monitoring and a more conservative approach to "comfortable" blowout predictions.

**Lesson**: High-confidence blowout predictions are risky when key personnel is missing. Always verify the active roster.
