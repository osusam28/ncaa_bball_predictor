## 📝 Analysis
**Rating: Significantly Off**

The prediction was incorrect, primarily because it underestimated Illinois' efficiency and the impact of individual player performance.
- **Wagler's Dominance**: Keaton Wagler scored 28 points (23 in the 2nd half). The prediction mentioned him as a POY candidate but didn't weigh his explosive scoring potential heavily enough in a high-stakes road environment.
- **Offensive Power**: Illinois entered with the #1 Adjusted Offense in KenPom history. While Nebraska's #7 defense was noted, Illinois' historical efficiency proved too much to contain, even in Lincoln.
- **Rebounding & Depth**: Illinois won the rebounding battle and utilized their length to draw fouls, neutralizing Nebraska's home-court advantage.

## 💡 Improvements
- **Weight Recent Form Higher**: Wagler was coming off a 46-point game and was National Player of the Week. This high-ceiling potential should be more heavily weighted in "Strength vs. Strength" matchups.
- **Adjust Offense/Defense Coefficients**: When facing a historic #1 offense, the defensive edge should be discounted unless the defense is also historic (#1 or #2).
- **Road Performance Factor**: Illinois had already secured a top-5 road win recently; their "road resilience" was higher than anticipated.
